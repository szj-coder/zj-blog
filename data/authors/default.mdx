## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" />

I mainly use java as a programming language, but I want to explore different programming languages and their programming styles.

I like programming, travel and video games.

## Why have this blog?

> Because sharing is learning

I started this blog as a way to document and share the things I have learned and found useful in my journey as a software engineer.

I would be highly appreciated if you could leave your comments and thoughts on what I have written <Twemoji emoji="clinking-beer-mugs" />.
